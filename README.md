# numberCompare

The NumericCompare class is used to compare the relative values of two "number" values, regardless of their original 
type using a Numeric wrapper class. 

Notes:
Currently Integer, Double, String, Long and hex (stored in a String) are supported.
Since the Numeric class uses Double internally, it is susceptible to the inhert weakness of the double type.
